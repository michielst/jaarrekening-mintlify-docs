## Welcome to the Jaarrekening.be API

This documentation helps you interact with our API to access financial, legal, and structural data about all Belgian enterprises. Youâ€™ll find endpoints for enterprise profiles, annual reports, directors, ratios, and investments â€” all powered by official sources.

Everything starts with an API token. Youâ€™ll need this to authenticate with our endpoints.
